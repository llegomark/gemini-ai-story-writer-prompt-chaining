Driven by their suspicions, Whiskers and Luna embarked on a clandestine investigation. They knew their actions bordered on treason, but the need for truth outweighed their fear of reprisal. They began by discreetly probing the minds of their Felinian comrades, searching for inconsistencies and hidden anxieties. They delved into the archives of Felinia, sifting through ancient texts and fragmented historical accounts.

Their efforts were met with resistance. The Felinians, while welcoming them as allies, were guarded about their past. The war with the Cynoids was a painful chapter in their history, one they seemed hesitant to revisit. But Whiskers and Luna persisted, their determination fueled by the conviction that the truth, however unsettling, was essential to achieving lasting peace.

Their investigation led them to a startling discovery. The war, they learned, was not simply a fight for survival against a technologically superior foe. It was a war rooted in a deep-seated prejudice, a fear of the Cynoids' advanced cybernetic enhancements. The Felinians, for all their telepathic prowess, were deeply distrustful of technology, viewing it as a perversion of their natural abilities. This fear, they realized, had blinded the Felinians to the possibility of peaceful coexistence, leading them to demonize the Cynoids and perpetuate a cycle of violence.

Armed with this newfound knowledge, Whiskers and Luna decided to confront the Council of Elders. They knew the risks, but they could no longer remain silent. They entered the council chamber, their hearts pounding with a mixture of trepidation and resolve.

"Elders," Whiskers began, his voice echoing in the cavernous chamber, "we have uncovered a truth that can no longer be ignored. The war with the Cynoids is not solely a fight for survival; it is fueled by fear and prejudice."

The elders stirred, their faces etched with surprise and anger. "You dare question our wisdom?" one of them boomed, his voice laced with indignation. "We have fought for generations to protect our way of life from the Cynoid threat."

"But at what cost?" Luna challenged. "How many lives have been lost in the name of this fear? Is it not time to consider another path?"

The elders remained silent, their expressions unreadable. Whiskers pressed on, "We have witnessed the Cynoids firsthand. They are not the monsters you have painted them to be. They, too, desire peace, a chance to coexist."

The council chamber erupted in a cacophony of telepathic whispers. The elders, their faces contorted with anger and confusion, argued amongst themselves. Some accused the Earth cats of naivety, others of treachery. But a few, their eyes filled with a flicker of doubt, seemed to consider their words.

After a tense silence, the Maine Coon elder addressed them. "You have brought forth a truth that we cannot ignore. We will convene and discuss this matter further. Until then, you are confined to your quarters."

Disheartened but not defeated, Whiskers and Luna retreated to their designated dwelling. They knew they had planted a seed of doubt within the council, a seed that could potentially blossom into a new era of peace and understanding.

Days turned into weeks as the council deliberated. The Earth cats, confined to their quarters, anxiously awaited the outcome. They spent their time honing their telepathic abilities, reaching out to each other and to sympathetic Felinians within the settlement. They knew that the future of both Felinia and Earth hung in the balance.

Finally, they were summoned back to the council chamber. The elders, their faces etched with the weight of their decision, awaited them. The Maine Coon elder stepped forward, his gaze solemn. "We have reached a decision," he announced. "We will send an envoy to the Cynoids, seeking a ceasefire and the possibility of a peace treaty."

A wave of relief washed over Whiskers and Luna. Their efforts had not been in vain. They had challenged the status quo, forced the Felinians to confront their prejudices, and opened the door to a peaceful resolution.

But their journey was far from over. The path to peace was fraught with obstacles. The Cynoids, wary of betrayal, would need convincing. The Felinian populace, steeped in generations of animosity, would need to be guided towards acceptance. And there were those within the Felinian leadership who still clung to the old ways, who saw peace as a weakness and the Cynoids as an existential threat.

Whiskers and Luna, along with their Earth companions, knew they had a vital role to play in this delicate dance of diplomacy and reconciliation. They would act as ambassadors, bridging the gap between the two warring factions. They would advocate for peace, challenging the ingrained prejudices and advocating for a future where Felinians and Cynoids could coexist.

Their journey would be fraught with danger and uncertainty, but they were determined to see it through. They had come to Felinia as ordinary house cats, but they had become so much more. They were warriors, diplomats, and above all, beacons of hope in a world ravaged by war. 

The fate of Felinia, and perhaps even Earth, rested on their shoulders. And they were ready to face the challenge.
